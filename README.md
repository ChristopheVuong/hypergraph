# Configuration Models of Random Hypergraphs and Their Applications

This is the software repository accompanying the paper "Configuration Models of Random Hypergraphs and Their Applications" by Phil Chodrow. It includes the `hypergraph` class used in conducting all analyses presented in the main text. Python 3.5+ is required, as well as the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. See `tutorial.ipynb` for an illustration of how to use the software to conduct significance tests against hypergraph null models. The illustration data is derived from the `email-Enron` corpus shared by Austin Benson on his data [website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/).
